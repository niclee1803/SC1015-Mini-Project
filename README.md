# Forecasting the Likelihood of Heart Disease

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) where we investigate the key clinical features that can help forecast the likelihood of heart disease.

## Dataset used
Our dataset: [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset by fedesoriano on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)  
It contains 11 clinical features for predicting heart disease events.  
We have included the file ([heart.csv](https://github.com/niclee1803/SC1015-Mini-Project/blob/main/Dataset/heart.csv)) in the Dataset folder.
