# Key clinical characteristics that can help forecast the likelihood of heart disease

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) where we investigate the key clinical features that can help forecast the likelihood of heart disease.

## Dataset used
Our dataset: Heart Failure Prediction Dataset by fedesoriano on Kaggle.\
(Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) \ 
It conntains 11 clinical features for predicting heart disease events.\
We have included the file (heart.csv) in the Dataset folder.
