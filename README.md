# Heart Disease Prediction

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) where we investigate the key clinical features that can help forecast the likelihood of heart disease.

## Dataset used
Our dataset: [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset by fedesoriano on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)  
It contains 11 clinical features for predicting heart disease events.  
We have included the [file](https://github.com/niclee1803/SC1015-Mini-Project/blob/main/Dataset/heart.csv) in the Dataset folder of this repository.

## Problem Definition
According to the WHO, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, claiming an estimated 17.9 million lives each year.    
According to the Singapore Heart Foundation, in Singapore alone, 23 people die from cardiovascular diseases every day.
   
From these statistics, we can see that there is an urgent need for early detection and management of CVDs, especially for individuals at high risk due to factors like hypertension or diabetes.    
    
We decided to work on using machine learning models to identify the key clinical features that can help forecast the likelihood of a patient developing heart disease.    


## Models Used
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. K Nearest Neighbours Classifier


## Conclusion


## What we learnt from this project
